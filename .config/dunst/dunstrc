# * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple
#             ones, open the context menu.
# * close_current: Close current notification.
# * close_all: Close all notifications.

# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by

#
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
